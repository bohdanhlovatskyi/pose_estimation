- [TODO]: asserts on the matrices having the form they need

- why Up2P gives such a bad results ? 

- YES: why rotation matrix after prerotation gets affected in all the dimensions ? - multiplication mismatch somewhere?
- YES: check that for Identity prerotation results are of the same magnitude for both no- and prerotation based solvers
- YES: why euler angles are sometime (-180, y, 180) and sometimes (0, y, 0) - is it possible that this introduces a bug somewhere?
